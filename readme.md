# Project 2 Assessment Starter Code

This repo contains the starter code for the [assessment of Node, Express, and PostgreSQL](https://github.com/WDI-SEA/wdi_assessments/blob/master/project_assessments/project-2-assessment.md) knowledge that students will complete following unit 2 of the Software Engineering Immersive course.

## Set Up

### Step 1: Fork and Clone

1. Fork the starter code repo
2. Copy clone link from the forked repo
3. Use the `git clone <LINK>` on your terminal in a location that is not inside of another git repository.

### Step 2: Install Node Modules

All necessary node modules have been added as dependencies. For reference, here is what they are:

* ejs
* express
* method-override
* pg
* sequelize

You will need to install these after cloning down your fork using `npm i`.

> Tip: You don't need to run `npm init`!

### Step 3: Implement the App

[See assessment prompt for detailed instructions](https://github.com/WDI-SEA/wdi_assessments/blob/master/project_assessments/project-2-assessment.md).

### Step 4: Deploy and Turn-in

Once you have completed the requirements, deploy the app to Heroku or some other platform of your choice. Take the link to the live site (**not** your Github repo), and send it via slack to your instructional team.
